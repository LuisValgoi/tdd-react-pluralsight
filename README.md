# Notes

Its common to store artefacts into `containers` and `components`.

### Containers

`App.js` its a container. Its purpose its to hold other `components`.

They also handle the state of the app.

### Components

If its does more than rendering a pieace of the UI, it's called a smart/statefull component.

The `Header.js` it's a stateless component.
